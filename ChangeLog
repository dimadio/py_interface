version 0.96, 2008-Dec-17
	Applied two patches from Anton Krasovsky:
	* The first fixes a crash when the connection from python to
	  erlang node is terminated, because the erlang node has gone down
	  or stopped replying to pings
	* The second fixes a crash when a connection between python node
	  and the erlang node has been broken due to lack of ping
	  responses from the erlang node (erlang process was suspended),
	  and then when erlang process is resumed and terminated,
	  exception was thrown.

	Fixed a few cases of the version number not getting properly
	inserted into all files, and one bug related to buildning: now all
	files needed to build gets properly included in the distribution
	tar file.
